Hi, welcome to my website!
My name is Malin Ouyang (欧阳马霖), and I am an undergraduate student at the Department of Astronomy, Nanjing University, China. You can find my [CV](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) here.

My current research interests lie in cosmology, gravitation, and gravitational waves (it sounds broad because I am still exploring!). I am particularly interested in working at the interface between theory and observation—employing high-precision numerical simulations and analytical modeling to interpret and constrain observational results. Also I aim to explore how different theoretical models govern the universe's behavior, and to develop methods to test the physical phenomena they predict.

I have been investigating how dark matter influences anisotropies in the gravitational-wave background and worked on interpreting the cosmic variance in spatial correlations. Additionally, with the transformative impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on astrophysics, I am enthusiastic about embedding new AI modules into research pipelines to accelerate and enrich scientific discovery. I have used deep learning techniques to detect gravitational-wave signals from binary mergers and successfully reproduced previous results by substituting traditional models.

Currently, I am visiting Munich under the supervision of Professor Daniel Gruen, where I am part of a team searching for new electromagnetic counterparts associated with gravitational-wave events from the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run. Beyond daily observation and data analysis tasks, I focus on interpreting our data through light-curve modeling and detectability analysis. We aim to refine detection limits by identifying parameter combinations that render astrophysical events undetectable under current observational constraints, thereby offering theoretical insights to optimize follow-up strategies.

**Just like my website, I am still constructing the building in my academic career ( now maybe just laying the foundation). I am always enthusiastic about discussing science and collaborating with others. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my work or just want to chat about exciting ideas!**
